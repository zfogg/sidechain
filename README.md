# Sidechain üéµ

> Social "Stories" for Music Producers - Share loops directly from your DAW

Sidechain is a VST3/AU plugin that brings social media into your music production workflow. Share 8-bar loops, discover what other producers are making, and build a community without ever leaving Ableton Live.

## Why Sidechain?

**The Problem**: Producers are isolated in their DAWs, spending hours perfecting loops that no one ever hears. Existing platforms like SoundCloud are antisocial, Instagram doesn't understand music, and TikTok is for finished tracks, not the creative process.

**The Solution**: A social feed that lives inside your DAW. One click to share what you're working on, infinite scroll to discover fresh inspiration, all without disrupting your creative flow.

## FAQ

**Q: Will this crash my DAW?**
A: We're obsessive about stability. All network operations run on background threads, and we test extensively with high CPU projects.

**Q: What about copyright issues?**
A: Phase 1 focuses on original content sharing. Audio fingerprinting for copyright protection is planned for v2.

**Q: Which DAWs are supported?**
A: Starting with Ableton Live (most producers), then FL Studio and Logic Pro. VST3/AU compatibility means most DAWs should work.

**Q: Is my audio data private?**
A: You control what you share. Private sessions stay private. All uploaded audio can be deleted anytime.

**Q: How much does it cost?**
A: Free for basic features. Pro tier ($5/month) planned with unlimited uploads and analytics.
