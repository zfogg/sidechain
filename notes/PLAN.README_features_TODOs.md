### R.3.3 Cross-DAW MIDI Collaboration

> **Current State**: Not implemented.
> **Target**: MIDI as a first-class resource that users can share, download, and import into their DAW.

> **Design Decision**: MIDI is a standalone primitive (`/api/v1/midi/:id`), not tied to posts.
> This allows MIDI to be shared independently, reused across posts/stories/challenges, and
> enables a future MIDI library feature. Posts and Stories can optionally *reference* a MIDI ID.

> **Testing**: Manual testing with multiple DAWs.
> Test: User A uploads MIDI → Gets shareable link → User B downloads .mid file → Imports into DAW.
> Test: User A records post with MIDI → MIDI auto-uploaded → Available for download on post.
