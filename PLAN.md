Upload Infrastructure

Implement multipart upload from VST to backend
Process audio server-side: normalize loudness to -14 LUFS
Upload processed file to CDN with unique ID
Return CDN URL and metadata to VST
Store post metadata in database (PostgreSQL)

Deliverable: Can capture and upload 8-bar loops from Ableton

## Phase 3: Feed Integration (Week 5-6)
Stream.io Feed Setup

Configure user, timeline, and global feed groups
Implement activity creation when loop uploaded:
Actor: user:id
Verb: posted
Object: loop:id
Custom: audio_url, bpm, key, waveform

Add pagination support (20 posts per page)
Cache feed data locally to reduce API calls

Basic Feed UI

Create scrollable feed view in VST window
Display posts with waveform preview and metadata
Implement audio preview playback through DAW monitoring

## Phase 4: Social Features (Week 7-8)
Engagement System

Add heart/like button with optimistic UI updates
Implement follow/unfollow functionality
Create "Following" feed tab alongside "Global"
Add play count tracking (increment on preview)
Display engagement metrics on posts

Profile System

Basic profile view (username, follower count, posts)
"My Posts" tab to see your own loops
Implement pull-to-refresh for feed updates
Add notification badge for new follower/likes
Store user preferences (volume, auto-play settings)

Deliverable: Full social interaction capability

## Phase 5: Real-time Features (Week 9-10)
WebSocket Integration

Establish WebSocket connection to Stream.io
Show "🟢 Producing Now" status when DAW open
Real-time notification for new posts in timeline

## Phase 6: Polish & Launch Prep (Week 11-12)
Performance Optimization

Implement audio preview caching (last 10 played)
Add lazy loading for feed images/waveforms
Optimize render performance (60fps scrolling)
Thread all network calls to avoid audio dropouts
Add offline mode with queue for posts

Stability & Testing

Test with high CPU projects (90%+ usage)
Verify no memory leaks over extended sessions
Cross-DAW testing (FL Studio, Logic minimum)
Add crash reporting (Sentry integration)
Implement auto-save for drafts

Deliverable: Beta-ready VST plugin

Discord server for feedback
Daily iteration on top issues
Monitor Stream.io analytics
Gather feature requests

Week 14: Public Beta

Post on r/WeAreTheMusicMakers
Submit to Product Hunt
Reach out to producer YouTube channels
Add waitlist for overwhelm management
Implement rate limiting

Success Metrics
Technical:

<100ms audio preview start time
<2% crash rate
<500ms feed load time
99% upload success rate

Engagement:

50% DAU/MAU ratio
3+ loops played per session
30% users post within first week
5+ follows per active user

Risk Mitigation
Technical Risks:

DAW crashes: Extensive testing, gradual rollout
Audio sync issues: Buffer size detection, latency compensation
Stream.io downtime: Local cache, queue failed requests

User Risks:

Copyright concerns: Audio fingerprinting in v2
Toxic behavior: Report system, Stream.io moderation
Ghost town: Seed with quality content, invite key producers

## MIDI Integration & Creative Features

Beyond audio loops, Sidechain becomes a playground for MIDI creativity and producer collaboration.

### 1. MIDI Pattern Sharing 📝
**Concept**: Share the musical ideas behind the loops

**Features:**
- Upload MIDI patterns alongside audio loops
- "Download MIDI" button lets producers grab the pattern
- "Remix this pattern" generates algorithmic variations
- MIDI data drives visual effects and feed animations

**Technical Implementation:**
- Parse MIDI files server-side for metadata extraction
- Store MIDI data as JSON in database for web compatibility
- Generate piano roll SVG visualizations
- Real-time MIDI playback in browser using Tone.js

### 2. MIDI Visualization Engine 🎨
**Concept**: Interactive visual voting on musical ideas themselves

**Core Feature: Votable Piano Rolls**
- **Click piano roll sections** to vote on specific chord progressions
- **Hover over notes** to see vote counts and comments
- **"Best Progression"** badges appear on highly-voted sections
- **Community consensus** on what sounds good emerges organically

**Interactive MIDI Elements:**
- Animated piano rolls that light up as audio plays
- **Click any chord** to vote 🔥/❤️/🎵 on that specific progression
- MIDI data creates dynamic waveform colors (blue for bass, yellow for melody)
- Particle effects triggered by note velocities
- **Heat maps** showing which chord progressions are trending community-wide

**Visual Feedback System:**
- C major posts get warm orange/yellow colors (voted "happy")
- Minor keys get cool blue/purple themes (voted "moody") 
- High-voted progressions get golden highlighting
- Complex chord progressions create kaleidoscope effects when highly rated

### 3. The Synth Easter Egg 🥚
**Concept**: Hidden synthesizer unlocked by secret MIDI chord sequence

**Discovery Flow:**
1. Producer discovers secret chord (F#m7add11 or similar)
2. Hidden synth interface appears in VST
3. Custom FM + modern bass sound engine unlocks
4. Play melodies directly into Sidechain to create instant posts

**Synth Features:**
- Retro 80s FM synthesis + modern sub-bass
- Auto-detects key/tempo from played patterns
- "Record Performance" captures both audio + MIDI
- Weekly "featured synth" with different sound packs

**Community Aspect:**
- Posts tagged with "🎹 Synth Sessions" 
- Leaderboard for best synth performances
- Producer challenges: "Create a track using only the hidden synth"

### 4. MIDI Battle Royale 🏆
**Concept**: Weekly producer competitions with creative constraints

**Weekly Challenges:**
- **MIDI Monday**: Create loops using only the hidden synth
- **Pattern Wednesday**: Remix community MIDI patterns
- **Key Challenge**: All tracks must be in the featured key (e.g., F# minor week)
- **BPM Lock**: Everyone builds at exactly 128 BPM

**Gamification:**
- Real-time voting with emoji reactions
- Winner gets featured on global feed
- Special "Battle Winner" badge on profile
- Community playlists of battle submissions

**Implementation:**
- Challenge system in Stream.io feeds
- Special challenge feed type
- Voting mechanism via reactions
- Automated winner selection based on engagement

### 5. Advanced MIDI Features (V3+)
**Long-term Vision:**

**MIDI Collaboration:**
- Real-time MIDI jam sessions between producers
- "Pass the pattern" - producers add layers to existing MIDI
- MIDI version control - see how patterns evolved

**AI-Powered MIDI:**
- "Complete this pattern" using AI music generation
- Style transfer: "Make this sound like Deadmau5"
- Auto-harmonization suggestions

**Cross-DAW MIDI Sync:**
- Send MIDI directly between VST instances
- "Collab Mode" - producers work on same project remotely
- MIDI clock sync for remote jamming

Future Roadmap (Post-MVP)
V2 Features:

Collaborative playlists
Stem separation for remixes
MIDI pattern sharing
Project file exchange
In-DAW purchasing

Monetization:

Pro tier ($5/month): Unlimited posts, analytics
Loop marketplace: 20% transaction fee
Brand partnerships: Sponsored producer content
Native DAW integration licensing

This plan gets you from zero to launched in 14 weeks with a focused MVP that solves the core problem: producers want to share and discover loops without leaving their DAW. Everything else can iterate based on user feedback.
