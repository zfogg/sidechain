// This file is intentionally minimal - Catch2 will find all tests automatically
// Run with: g++ -std=c++17 -I../Source -I../../deps/JUCE/modules run_tests.cpp -o test_runner

// Note: For JUCE tests, we need to link against JUCE libraries
// This is a placeholder - real tests would need proper JUCE linking
